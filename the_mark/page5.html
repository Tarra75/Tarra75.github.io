                “And then I came into the room. They were discussing botany. I said how I’d seen a flower 
                growing on a dust heap on the site of an old house in Kingsway. The seed, I said, must have 
                been sown in the reign of Charles the First. What flowers grew in the reign of Charles the First?” 
                I asked—(but, I don’t remember the answer). Tall flowers with purple tassels to them perhaps. And 
                so it goes on. All the time I’m dressing up the figure of myself in my own mind, lovingly, stealthily, 
                not openly adoring it, for if I did that, I should catch myself out, and stretch my hand at once for 
                a book in self-protection. Indeed, it is curious how instinctively one protects the image of oneself 
                from idolatry or any other handling that could make it ridiculous, or too unlike the original to be 
                believed in any longer. Or is it not so very curious after all? It is a matter of great importance. 
                Suppose the looking glass smashes, the image disappears, and the romantic figure with the green of 
                forest depths all about it is there no longer, but only that shell of a person which is seen by other 
                people—what an airless, shallow, bald, prominent world it becomes! A world not to be lived in. As we
                 face each other in omnibuses and underground railways we are looking into the mirror that accounts 
                 for the vagueness, the gleam of glassiness, in our eyes. And the novelists in future will realize 
                 more and more the importance of these reflections, for of course there is not one reflection but an 
                 almost infinite number; those are the depths they will explore, those the phantoms they will pursue,
                  leaving the description of reality more and more out of their stories, taking a knowledge of it for 
                  granted, as the Greeks did and Shakespeare perhaps—but these generalizations are very worthless. The 
                  military sound of the word is enough. It recalls leading articles, cabinet ministers—a whole class of 
                  things indeed which as a child one thought the thing itself, the standard thing, the real thing, from 
                  which one could not depart save at the risk of nameless damnation. Generalizations bring back somehow 
                  Sunday in London, Sunday afternoon walks, Sunday luncheons, and also ways of speaking of the dead, 
                  clothes, and habits—like the habit of sitting all together in one room until a certain hour, although
                  nobody liked it. There was a rule for everything. The rule for tablecloths at that particular period 
                  was that they should be made of tapestry with little yellow compartments marked upon them, such as 
                  you may see in photographs of the carpets in the corridors of the royal palaces. Tablecloths of a 
                  different kind were not real tablecloths. How shocking, and yet how wonderful it was to discover that 
                  these real things, Sunday luncheons, Sunday walks, country houses, and tablecloths were not entirely
                   real, were indeed half phantoms, and the damnation which visited the disbeliever in them was only a
                    sense of illegitimate freedom. What now takes the place of those things I wonder, those real standard 
                    things? Men perhaps, should you be a woman; the masculine point of view which governs our lives, which 
                    sets the standard, which establishes Whitaker’s Table of Precedency, which has become, I suppose, since 
                    the war half a phantom to many men and women, which soon—one may hope, will be laughed into the dustbin
                     where the phantoms go, the mahogany sideboards and the Landseer prints, Gods and Devils, Hell and so 
                     forth, leaving us all with an intoxicating sense of illegitimate freedom—if freedom exists....

              take place on a summer’s evening—But how dull this is, this historical fiction! It doesn’t
               interest me at all. I wish I could hit upon a pleasant track of thought, a track 
               indirectly reflecting credit upon myself, for those are the pleasantest thoughts, and 
               very frequent even in the minds of modest mouse-coloured people, who believe genuinely

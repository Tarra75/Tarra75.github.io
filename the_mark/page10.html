        I like to think of the tree itself:—first the close dry sensation of being wood; then
         the grinding of the storm; then the slow, delicious ooze of sap. I like to think of it,
          too, on winter’s nights standing in the empty field with all leaves close-furled, nothing 
          tender exposed to the iron bullets of the moon, a naked mast upon an earth that goes tumbling, 
          tumbling, all night long.

               The song of birds must sound very loud and strange in June; and how

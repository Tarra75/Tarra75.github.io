        How shocking, and yet how wonderful it was to discover that 
        these real things, Sunday luncheons, Sunday walks, country 
        houses, and tablecloths were not entirely real, were indeed half phantoms,
         and the damnation which visited the disbeliever in them was only a sense

         those real standard things? Men perhaps, should you be a woman; the masculine 
         point of view which governs our lives, which sets the standard, which establishes 
         Whitaker’s Table of Precedency, which has become, I suppose, since the war half a 
         phantom to many men and women, which soon—one may hope, will be laughed into the 
         dustbin where the phantoms go, the mahogany sideboards and the Landseer prints, 
         Gods and Devils, Hell and so forth, leaving us all with an intoxicating sense of
          illegitimate freedom—if freedom exists... In certain lights that mark on the wall
           seems actually to project from the wall.

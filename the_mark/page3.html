                But as for that mark, I’m not sure 
                about it; I don’t believe it was made by a nail after all; it’s too big, too round, for that. 
                I might get up, but if I got up and looked at it, ten to one I shouldn’t be able to say for 
                certain; because once a thing’s done, no one ever knows how it happened. Oh! dear me, the 
                mystery of life; The inaccuracy of thought! The ignorance of humanity! To show how very little 
                control of our possessions we have—what an accidental affair this living is after all our 
                civilization—let me just count over a few of the things lost in one lifetime, beginning, 
                for that seems always the most mysterious of losses—what cat would gnaw, what rat would 
                nibble—three pale blue canisters of book-binding tools? Then there were the bird cages, the 
                iron hoops, the steel skates, the Queen Anne coal-scuttle, the bagatelle board, the hand 
                organ—all gone, and jewels, too. Opals and emeralds, they lie about the roots of turnips. 
                What a scraping paring affair it is to be sure! The wonder is that I’ve any clothes on my back, 
                that I sit surrounded by solid furniture at this moment. Why, if one wants to compare life to 
                anything, one must liken it to being blown through the Tube at fifty miles an hour—landing at 
                the other end without a single hairpin in one’s hair! Shot out at the feet of God entirely naked!
                 Tumbling head over heels in the asphodel meadows like brown paper parcels pitched down a shoot 
                 in the post office! With one’s hair flying back like the tail of a race-horse. Yes, that seems 
                 to express the rapidity of life, the perpetual waste and repair; all so casual, all so 
                 haphazard....But after life. The slow pulling down of thick green stalks so that the cup 
                 of the flower, as it turns over, deluges one with purple and red light. Why, after all, should
                  one not be born there as one is born here, helpless, speechless, unable to focus one’s eyesight,
                   groping at the roots of the grass, at the toes of the Giants? As for saying which are trees,
                    and which are men and women, or whether there are such things, that one won’t be in a
                     condition to do for fifty years or so. There will be nothing but spaces of light and dark, 
                     intersected by thick stalks, and rather higher up perhaps, rose-shaped blots of an indistinct
                      colour—dim pinks and blues—which will, as time goes on, become more definite, become—I don’t
                       know what....

                And yet that mark on the wall is not a hole at all. It may even be caused by some 
                round black substance, such as a small rose leaf, left over from the summer, and I, 
                not being a very vigilant housekeeper—look at the dust on the mantelpiece, for example, 
                the dust which, so they say, buried Troy three times over, only fragments of pots utterly 
                refusing annihilation, as one can believe. The tree outside the window taps very gently 
                on the pane.... I want to think quietly, calmly, spaciously, never to be interrupted, 
                never to have to rise from my chair, to slip easily from one thing to another, without 
                any sense of hostility, or obstacle. I want to sink deeper and deeper, away from the 
                surface, with its hard separate facts. To steady myself, let me catch hold of the first 
                idea that passes.... Shakespeare.... Well, he will do as well as another. A man who sat 
                himself solidly in an arm-chair, and looked into the fire, so— A shower of ideas fell 
                perpetually from some very high Heaven down through his mind. He leant his forehead on 
                his hand, and people, looking in through the open door,—for this scene is supposed to 
                take place on a summer’s evening—But how dull this is, this historical fiction! It doesn’t
                 interest me at all. I wish I could hit upon a pleasant track of thought, a track 
                 indirectly reflecting credit upon myself, for those are the pleasantest thoughts, and 
                 very frequent even in the minds of modest mouse-coloured people, who believe genuinely 
                 that they dislike to hear their own praises. They are not thoughts directly praising 
                 oneself; that is the beauty of them; they are thoughts like this:

  “And then I came into the room. They were discussing botany. I 
  said how I’d seen a flower growing on a dust heap on the site of 
  an old house in Kingsway. The seed, I said, must have been sown in
   the reign of Charles the First. What flowers grew in the reign of 
   Charles the First?” I asked—(but, I don’t remember the answer).
    Tall flowers with purple tassels to them perhaps. And so it goes
     on. All the time I’m dressing up the figure of myself in my own 
     mind, lovingly, stealthily, not openly adoring it, for if I did
      that, I should catch myself out, and stretch my hand at once
       for a book in self-protection. Indeed, it is curious how 
       instinctively one protects the image of oneself from idolatry 
       or any other handling that could make it ridiculous, or too 
       unlike the original to be believed in any longer. Or is it 
       not so very curious after all? It is a matter of great 
       importance. Suppose the looking glass smashes, the image 
       disappears, and the romantic figure with the green of forest
        depths all about it is there no longer, but only that shell 
        of a person which is seen by other people—what an airless, 
        shallow, bald, prominent world it becomes! A world not to be 
        lived in. As we face each other in omnibuses and underground 
        railways we are looking into the mirror that accounts for the 
        vagueness, the gleam of glassiness, in our eyes. And the 
        novelists in future will realize more and more the importance 
        of these reflections, for of course there is not one reflection 
        but an almost infinite number; those are the depths they will
         explore, those the phantoms they will pursue, leaving the
          description of reality more and more out of their stories, 
          taking a knowledge of it for granted, as the Greeks did and 
          Shakespeare perhaps—but these generalizations are very 
          worthless. The military sound of the word is enough. It
           recalls leading articles, cabinet ministers—a whole class of 
           things indeed which as a child one thought the thing itself, 
           the standard thing, the real thing, from which one could not 
           depart save at the risk of nameless damnation. Generalizations 
           bring back somehow Sunday in London, Sunday afternoon walks, 
           Sunday luncheons, and also ways of speaking of the dead, 
           clothes, and habits—like the habit of sitting all together
            in one room until a certain hour, although nobody liked it. 
            There was a rule for everything. The rule for tablecloths at 
            that particular period was that they should be made of tapestry
             with little yellow compartments marked upon them, such as you 
             may see in photographs of the carpets in the corridors of the 
             royal palaces. Tablecloths of a different kind were not real 
             tablecloths.

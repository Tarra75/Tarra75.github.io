          Here is nature once more at her old game of self-preservation. This train of thought, she 
    perceives, is threatening mere waste of energy, even some collision with reality, for who 
    will ever be able to lift a finger against Whitaker’s Table of Precedency? The Archbishop of
     Canterbury is followed by the Lord High Chancellor; the Lord High Chancellor is followed by the 
     Archbishop of York. Everybody follows somebody, such is the philosophy of Whitaker; and the great 
     thing is to know who follows whom.

               Whitaker knows, and let that, so Nature counsels, comfort you, 
     instead of enraging you; and if you can’t be comforted, if you must shatter this hour of peace, 
     think of the mark on the wall. I understand Nature’s game—her prompting to take action as a way of
      ending any thought that threatens to excite or to pain. Hence, I suppose, comes our slight contempt
       for men of action—men, we assume, who don’t think. Still, there’s no harm in putting a full stop 
       to one’s disagreeable thoughts by looking at a mark on the wall. Indeed, now that I have fixed
        my eyes upon it, I feel that I have grasped a plank in the sea; I feel a satisfying sense of 
        reality which at once turns the two Archbishops and the Lord High Chancellor to the shadows of 
        shades. Here is something definite, something real.

          Thus, waking from a midnight dream of horror,
          one hastily turns on the light and lies quiescent, worshipping the chest of drawers, worshipping 
          solidity, worshipping reality, worshipping the impersonal world which is a proof of some 
          existence other than ours. That is what one wants to be sure of.... Wood is a pleasant thing 
          to think about. It comes from a tree; and trees grow, and we don’t know how they grow. For
           years and years they grow, without paying any attention to us, in meadows, in forests, and
            by the side of rivers—all things one likes to think about. The cows swish their tails beneath
             them on hot afternoons; they paint rivers so green that when a moorhen dives one expects to
              see its feathers all green when it comes up again. I like to think of the fish balanced 
              against the stream like flags blown out; and of water-beetles slowly raiding domes of mud 
              upon the bed of the river.

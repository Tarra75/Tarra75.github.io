     present that I first looked up and saw the mark on the wall. In order to fix a date it is necessary to remember
    what one saw. So now I think of the fire; the steady film of yellow light upon the
    page of my book; the three chrysanthemums in the round glass bowl on the
    mantelpiece. Yes, it must have been the winter time, and we had just finished
    our tea, for I remember that I was smoking a cigarette when I looked up and
    saw the mark on the wall for the first time. I looked up through the smoke of my
    cigarette and my eye lodged for a moment upon the burning coals, and that old
    fancy of the crimson flag flapping from the castle tower came into my mind,
    and I thought of the cavalcade of red knights riding up the side of the black
    rock. Rather to my relief the sight of the mark interrupted the fancy, for it is an
    old fancy, an automatic fancy, made as a child perhaps. The mark was a small
    round mark, black upon the white wall, about six or seven inches above the
    mantelpiece. How readily our thoughts swarm upon a new object, 
    lifting it a little way, as ants carry a blade of straw so feverishly, and then 
    leave it.... If that mark was made by a nail, it can’t have been for a picture, it
     must have been for a miniature—the miniature of a lady with white powdered curls, 
     wder-dusted cheeks, and lips like red carnations. A fraud of course, for the 
     people who had this house before us would have chosen pictures in that way—an 
     old picture for an old room. That is the sort of people they were—very interesting
      people, and I think of them so often, in such queer places, because one will 
      never see them again, never know what happened next. They wanted to leave this 
      house because they wanted to change their style of furniture, so he said, and 
      he was in process of saying that in his opinion art should have ideas behind 
      it when we were torn asunder, as one is torn from the old lady about to pour 
      out tea and the young man about to hit the tennis ball in the back garden of 
      the suburban villa as one rushes past in the train.
